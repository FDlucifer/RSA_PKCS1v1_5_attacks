# The 9 Lives of Bleichenbacher's CAT: New Cache ATtacks on TLS Implementations

This repository contains implementation of Bleichenbacher, Manger and Ben-Or attacks on RSA PKCS#1 v1.5. There are a mix of Sage and Python.

This is related to [this paper](http://cat.eyalro.net/).

There is even a "graphical" walkthrough of the Bleichenbacher attack in `bb98_graphic.sage`.
